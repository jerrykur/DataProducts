<h2>Grading Information</h2>

The following is a list of how this application meets the rubric defined for this project.

<h4>Rubric item 1 - Some form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)</h4>
<div>
	On the left panel are a series of widgets that let the user control the display.  The 
	user can select the year.  And on the histogram tab the user can select the display order, and 
	enter a threshold value for when to alert that number of Disaster Declartions.  When 
	this value is meet or exceeded a message will be displayed.
</div>

<h4>Rubric Item 2 - Some operation on the ui input in server.R</h4>
<div>
	When you review server.R you will see several reactive funtions that utilize the values entered by
	the user.   The histPlot utilizes the reactive renderPlot function to get the histogram display 
	based on the render the	year, histogram order, and alert threshold(see below).  In a similar fashion, the 
	USMap function uses gvisGeoChart to display a map of the states of the use color code by the number of 
	disaster declarations occured in that state during the selected year. 
</div>

<h4>Rubic Item 3 - Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations</h4>
<div>
	The reactive function, output$numDeclExceededMessage. This function reacts to changes in the user entered alert
	threshold value to display a message when the threshold is meet or exceeded.  If the threshold is 
	exceeded the function will calculate a percentage by which the threshold is exceeded.
</div>

<h4>Rubic Item 4 - enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application</h4>
<div>
	While the application is simply to use, the Info tab provides instruction on using the 
	application.
</div>

<h4>Rubic Item 5 - The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself</h4>
<div>
	Documentation for the application consists of this tab and the Info tab.  There should
	be more than enough information provided to allow use of the application.
</div>
